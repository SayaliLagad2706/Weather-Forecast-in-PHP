# Weather-Forecast-in-PHP
- The aim of this project is to display weather details of a location using PHP scripting on server-side
- The initial page enables the user to either input the street, city and state of the interested location or select a check-box to fetch his/her current location
- The server performs error handling on the input and makes GET/POST requests to several APIs like Google Geocode, forecast.io, IP-API and DarkSky API to fetch the weather forecast for the input location
- The required weather parameters are extracted by parsing the JSON data returned by these APIs
- The details are displayed on the screen in a visually appealing manner using various weather icons and using Google Charts to display the hourly temperature in graph format
- The application is hosted on AWS cloud
- The result is a well formatted web page with required details of the weather
- Refer to project_description.pdf for implementation details
